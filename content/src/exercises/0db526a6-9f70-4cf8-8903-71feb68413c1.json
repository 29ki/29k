    "description": "Self-compassion helps us to accept our shortcomings or failures as a normal part of the human experience and an opportunity for growth. We can also learn to accept that not everything is within their control. Sometimes, even with the best efforts, we may not achieve what they had hoped for. There may be things beyond them that contribute to this reality. When we exercise self-compassion we can set expectations for ourselves out of a desire to be healthy and flourishing rather than from a place of self-criticism."
